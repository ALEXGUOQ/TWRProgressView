TWRProgressView
=================

## TWRProgressView

A custom view component that lets the user easily present a progress view masked with an image containing an alpha channel (i.e. PNGs). The view's progress can be animated; foreground and background colors can be customized as well as the duration of the animation.

## Usage

Usage is easy.

Add the dependency to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios
pod 'TWRProgressView'
...
```

Run `pod install` to install the dependencies.

Next, import the header file wherever you want to use the picker:

```objc
#import "TWRProgressView.h"
```

The progress view can be set up either via Interface Builder (XIB and Storyboards) or programmatically:

```objc

```

```objc

```
